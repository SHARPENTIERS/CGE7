This is a modified version of CGE7 by **[Youkan700](https://github.com/SHARPENTIERS/CGE7)**, the screen editor for Sharp MZ700. The modifications are:

- Added Visual Studio 2022 project (also works with Jetbrains Rider)
- Translated UI
- Modified String input to allow lowercase with non Japanese character set
- Removed Japanese string input
- Added `2nd Character Set` checkbox in string input dialog to use 2nd charset upper case characters.

All these modifications require the international MZ 700 font ROM (can be found **[here](https://original.sharpmz.org/download/mz7cgint.zip)** - Rename the file as `MZ700FON.DAT` and put it in the same folder as the exe file).

- Added an `Export` option in the `File` menu. This option exports the screen as an assembly source. There are two export options: `Raw` and `Compressed`. `Raw` saves the screen as is, `Compressed` saves the screen with a RLE compression. This file also contains the animation blocks.

Here is the code to display the screen content:

        LD      HL,SCREEN_ATTRIBUTES
